# Code Explanation

## Summary

The provided C++ code defines a `Car` class that demonstrates various object-oriented programming concepts. This class includes multiple constructors, a copy assignment operator, and methods for managing and displaying car objects. The `main` function uses these features to create, manipulate, and compare `Car` objects.

## Input and Output

### Input

- **User Input**: The `createCar` function prompts the user to enter the car's name and speed.

### Output

- **Constructor and Destructor Messages**: The program prints messages when constructors and destructors are called.
- **Car Details**: Displays information about each car, including its name and speed.
- **Comparison Result**: Indicates which of two cars is faster based on their speed.

## How the Code Works

1. **Class Definition**:
   - **Attributes**: `name` (a string) and `speed` (an integer) are private.
   - **Constructors**:
     - **Default Constructor**: Initializes `name` to "Default name" and `speed` to 0. Prints "Default Constructor Called!".
     - **Parameterized Constructor**: Initializes `name` and `speed` with provided values. Prints "Parameterized Constructor Called!".
     - **Copy Constructor**: Initializes a new `Car` object by copying values from another `Car` object. Prints "Copy Constructor Called!".
   - **Copy Assignment Operator**: Assigns values from one `Car` object to another. Includes a self-assignment check and prints "Copy Assignment Operator Called!".
   - **Destructor**: Prints "Destructor Called!" when a `Car` object is destroyed.
   - **Methods**:
     - **Getters and Setters**: Methods to access and modify `name` and `speed`.
     - **Display Function**: Prints the car's name and speed.
     - **Comparison Operator**: Compares two cars based on their speed.

2. **Function `createCar`**:
   - Prompts the user for input and creates a `Car` object with the given name and speed.

3. **`main` Function**:
   - Creates and displays `Car` objects using different constructors.
   - Demonstrates the use of the copy constructor and assignment operator.
   - Compares two cars and prints which one is faster.
